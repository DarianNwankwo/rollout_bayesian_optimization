# Rollout Bayesian Optimization
This repository contains code and experiments for performing rollout
in Bayesian Optimization

### Issues
- [x] Refactor multi start optimization of expected improvement success criteria
- [ ] Perform the standard iteration of Bayesian optimization to sanity check existing framework.
- [ ] Run the experiments for acquisition function with a different starting point for the LDS and with
a different seed for random normal number generator.
